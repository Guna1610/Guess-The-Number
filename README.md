# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in Python

A simple command-line **Number Guessing Game** built in Python as part of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp*.

The computer picks a random number between **1 and 100**, and you have to guess it before you run out of attempts.  
Choose your difficulty level â€” **Easy (10 turns), Medium (7 turns), or Hard (4 turns)** â€” and see if you can beat the game!
